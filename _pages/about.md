Who would have known that I got into GitHub to fork a code and create my academic website from scratch! Perhaps I should change career. But I love being a linguist and I love humor studies. So I won't change career. I'll just continue learning new things that make my life better! Or perhaps I'll change this headline completely.

Under construction. I've already managed to make many changes in the front page. I've put a picture and some links. Feel free to check them out!
